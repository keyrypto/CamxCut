## Features Implemented

### 1. PWA Configuration
- **vite-plugin-pwa**: Configured with custom service worker strategy
- **Manifest**: Updated with offline capabilities and proper icons
- **Service Worker**: Custom implementation for comprehensive caching

### 2. Offline Video Support
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Videos are stored in IndexedDB when uploaded
- **Video Storage Utility**: `src/utils/videoStorage.ts` provides:
  - Store videos with metadata
  - Retrieve videos by ID
  - List all stored videos
  - Delete videos
  - Storage usage tracking

### 3. Caching Strategies
The service worker implements different caching strategies:
- **Videos**: CacheFirst - Videos are cached for 30 days
- **API Requests**: NetworkFirst with 5-minute cache
- **Static Assets**: StaleWhileRevalidate
- **HTML Pages**: NetworkFirst with 1-day cache
- **Fonts**: CacheFirst with 1-year expiration

### 4. Offline Indicators
- **Offline Status Hook**: `useOfflineStatus` tracks online/offline state
- **Visual Indicator**: Shows when app is offline or back online

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/utils/videoStorage.ts` - IndexedDB utility for video storage
- `src/hooks/useOfflineStatus.ts` - Hook for tracking online status
- `src/components/OfflineIndicator.tsx` - Visual offline status indicator
- `public/sw.js` - Enhanced service worker with offline support

### Modified Files
- `vite.config.ts` - Added PWA plugin configuration
- `src/main.tsx` - Service worker registration
- `src/components/VideoUpload.tsx` - Stores videos in IndexedDB on upload
- `src/App.tsx` - Added offline indicator component
- `public/manifest.json` - Added offline_enabled flag

## How It Works

### Video Upload Flow
1. User uploads a video file
2. Video is validated (format, size, duration)
3. Video metadata is extracted (width, height, duration)
4. Video is stored in IndexedDB for offline access
5. Blob URL is created for immediate use
6. Video can be used offline from IndexedDB

### Offline Operation
- **Video Editing**: All video operations (trimming, preview, export) work offline
- **Video Storage**: Videos stored in IndexedDB persist across sessions
- **App Shell**: Core app files are cached for offline access
- **API Calls**: Cached API responses available offline (with limitations)

## Testing Offline Functionality

1. **Install the PWA**:
   - Open the app in a browser
   - Look for "Install" prompt or use browser menu
   - Install the app

2. **Test Offline Mode**:
   - Upload a video while online
   - Disable network (airplane mode or DevTools)
   - Verify video operations still work
   - Check that uploaded videos are accessible

3. **Verify Caching**:
   - Open DevTools > Application > Service Workers
   - Check service worker is registered and active
   - View cached resources in Cache Storage
   - Check IndexedDB for stored videos

## Browser Support

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Limited support (iOS 11.3+)
- **Opera**: Full support

## Storage Limits

- **IndexedDB**: Browser-dependent (typically 50% of disk space)
- **Cache API**: Browser-dependent (typically 20% of disk space)
- **Video Storage**: Limited by available IndexedDB quota

## Notes

- Videos stored in IndexedDB use blob URLs that persist across sessions
- Service worker automatically updates when new version is available
- Offline mode gracefully degrades API-dependent features
- Video export works completely offline using client-side processing
